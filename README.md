# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
The best way to ensure my work is functional and secure is through testing. Testing will prove that the code is doing as what is intended or it will fail the test. Once a test case fails, it is important to reflect and use anylitical skills to resolve any issues. Then testing again and again until satisfied with the program.
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs and incorporate them into my program by documenting, reflecting, and providing my interpretions back to the user if needed. Many times the user may not know exactly how to declare their requirements for a program. In this case, it is good to declare a mockup to provide back to the user to make sure their needs are being met. Withing this course the requiremnts for the program were straightfoward and interpretion was not needed as much as it could be in the professional setting. In a professional setting more analytical skills will be needed to intepret the user requiremnts.
# How do I approach designing software?
The way I approach designing software would be from a student or beginner viewpoint. As a student, very new to world of oding, it is important for me to approach with a more studious viewpoint. This way I am sure to research and practice anything I may be unsure of for the requiremnts of the project. A lot of research and trial and error go into the way I approached designing my software for this course.
